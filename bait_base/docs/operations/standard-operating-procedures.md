# bAIt Standard Operating Procedures

This document outlines standard operating procedures for using bAIt in production beamline environments.

## Overview

These procedures ensure consistent, safe, and effective use of bAIt for beamline analysis and intelligence. All procedures are designed to be non-intrusive and analysis-only, maintaining the safety principle that bAIt does not control any hardware.

## General Operating Principles

### Safety First
- **Analysis Only**: bAIt never controls hardware directly
- **Read-Only Access**: All analysis is performed on configuration files and logs
- **Non-Intrusive**: Operations do not interfere with beamline experiments
- **Fail-Safe**: System failures do not affect beamline operations

### Reliability Standards
- **High Availability**: 99.5% uptime target for analysis services
- **Performance Standards**: Response times <30 seconds for queries
- **Data Integrity**: All analysis results are validated and consistent
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all operations and decisions
